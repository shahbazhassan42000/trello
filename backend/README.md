# User REST API with Roles

# Getting start

Just run the following commands in your terminal to start coding

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shahbazhassan42000/user-rest-api-crud.git
$ cd user-rest-api-crud
$ npm install
```

Then run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

The last command automatically runs the API exposed on http://localhost:8080

# Deployment

To create a build for production you need to build your current project with the following command:

`$ npm run build`
